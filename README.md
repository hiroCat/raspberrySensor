# raspberrySensor
a python program to use a existing module to log temperature into a db 

# content
It has different modules:
- bme280 => slightly modified from https://bitbucket.org/MattHawkinsUK/rpispy-misc code (https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2016/07/using-bme280-i2c-temperature-pressure-sensor-in-python/)
- main => soon to have all the logic , right now only a sleep and calling the bme280 module
- classes => different data structures , right now only the main one
